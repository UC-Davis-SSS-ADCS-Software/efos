# SGP4 Orbit Propagator
Found a Python package called sgp4.py that we can use for our SGP4 Orbit Propagator. Information on the package can be found here: https://pypi.org/project/sgp4/. Output of SGP4
gives x,y,z Cartesian coordinates in True Equator Mean Equinox (TEME) ECI Frame, which we will probably need to convert into a more common ECI Frame like J2000.

## To Do
- Verify output of sgp4.py
- Convert output to J2000 ECI Frame (or whichever ECI Frame we choose)
- Determine TLE input for our orbit
