 *
 * @brief Interface to the TRIAD algorithm.
 *
 * TRIAD calculates REALOP's relative attitude as a rotation matrix
 *  that represents the rotation from Earth-fixed coordinates to 
 *  satellite-fixed coordinates.
 * It does so by comparing a "triad" of vectors from each frame
 *  and working backwards to figure out their relationship.
 * These triads are constructed from the direction of Earth's
 *  magnetic field, the direction of the sun, and their cross
 *  product in each reference frame.
 * On REALOP, the Earth-frame vectors are calculated/looked up,
 *  while the satellite-frame vectors are measured by sensors.
 * The attitude matrix can later be converted into a quaternion
 *  or Euler angles.
 *
 *  See:
 *   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triad_method
 * 	 https://arc.aiaa.org/doi/10.2514/3.2555
 * 	 And check the SSS google drive!
