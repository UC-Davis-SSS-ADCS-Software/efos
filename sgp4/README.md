# SGP4
SGP4 stands for Simplified General Perturbations 4 and is arguably the most widely used propagator for simulating earth satellite orbits.
This module is my personal project to produce implementations in multiple languages.  There is an official government document released decades
ago that describes the theory and the software.  That document is known as Spacetrack Report #3.  In 2006 researchers at the Center for Space
Standards and Innovation ([CSSI](http://www.centerforspace.com/)) published a detailed study of the algorithm and more modern software implementations.  In addition to the paper they also
released the [software](http://www.centerforspace.com/downloads/).  Most importantly they produced an extensive set of test cases that cover multiple orbit regimes, potential singularities, and other
tricky orbits.

## Alpha-5 Format
In December 2020 Space-track.org announced a change to the object id format.  In order to accommodate more that 100 000 objects, the object id in TLEs will include alphabetic characters.  Iâ€™m in the process of updating each TLE and ElsetRec structure to provide basic support.  At this time the plan is to simply treat the id as a string.  There is a schema to convert alpha-5 to integers, but that is not required to parse and simulated TLEs.

# Overview
The astrodynamics calculations are all implemented as static functions in the SGP4 class/module.  The ElsetRec datastructure is used to maintain initialization state across those methods.  For convenience, I have implemented the TLE class.  The constructor accepts the two lines of the the two-line element set as arguments.  To then propagate (simulate) the orbit, I have implemented a few getRV methods in each language.  One will accept the number of minutes since the epoch as an argument.  In most languages, I've also implemented a version of getRV that accepts a Date or DateTime object to simulate the orbit at a specific point in time.  Sometimes, if I didn't find a helper class in the target language that I liked, I simply used the number of milliseconds since January 1, 1970 as the argument.

# FORTRAN 90
I'm a bit proud of this port myself.  I've been seeing SGP4 in FORTRAN for decades now.  However, all the other versions I've seen were using COMMON data blocks.  By porting the code from C to FORTRAN 90, I was able to organize the code in modules and take advantage of custom data types, ElsetRec and TLE.  Now others can include these modules in their code without having to have the common block.

# LibreOffice Basic
The first implementation of SGP4 I ever wrote was in VBA in Excel.  I did the implementation by converting a printout of the SpaceTrack Report #3 FORTRAN code to VBA as I typed it in.  I don't have Excel on my dev laptop, so I ported the C version of code to LibreOffice Basic. Very little documentation for this language exists (compared to other languages).  I was able to implement a set of macros in a Calc spreadsheet.  Most users will want to use the parseLines and getRV macros in the TLE module.  To verify the code with the standard test cases run the Main macro in the TestSGP4 module.  The velocity errors are similar to other languages.  However the position errors are about five times greater.  I'm not sure why that is, but many of the data types in Basic have a limited resolution compared to the other languages.
